# <span>Welcome to the</span> <br><em>Computer-Readable Legislation Project</em> (CRLP)

At the States of Jersey’s [Legislative Drafting Office](https://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/StatesGreffe/Pages/LegislativeDraftingOffice.aspx){:target="_blank"} (LDO) we have a 2.5-year Computer-Readable Legislation Project running to the middle of 2025 (part of the global “Rules as Code” initiative).

For more, see [**About the project**](/about), [**Our work**](/work), and the [**Team**](/team). We also have a [**Substack blog**](https://digitallegislation.substack.com){:target="_blank"}.

Our big **news** is that we have secured funding from the [Jersey Legal Information Board](https://www.jerseylaw.je/Pages/About.aspx){:target="_blank"} to work till June 2025 with the [**Centre for Digital Law**](https://cdl.smu.edu.sg/projects/research-project-computational-law-rpcl){:target="_blank"} at Singapore Management University on several ideas to see what [their **L4** DSL](https://github.com/smucclaw){:target="_blank"} (a “domain specific language” or DSL for law) can do with our project - see our [outline plan](https://osf.io/jauqb){:target="_blank"}. We will present some initial results at the [CALC/PCC Perth 2025 conference](https://www.calc.ngo/sites/default/files/APCC-CALC%202025%20regional%20drafting%20conference%20program%20%28as%20at%2019-2-25%29_0.pdf){:target="_blank"} shortly, and more demonstrations will be available soon.
