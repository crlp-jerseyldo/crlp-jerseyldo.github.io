# <span>Welcome to the</span> <br><em>Computer-Readable Legislation Project</em> (CRLP)

At the States of Jersey’s [Legislative Drafting Office](https://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/StatesGreffe/LegislativeDraftingOffice/Pages/index.aspx){:target="_blank"} (LDO) we have a Computer-Readable Legislation Project (part of the global “Rules as Code” initiative). It was funded from 2023 to mid-2025 and is now continuing on a volunteer basis.

For more, see [**About the project**](/about), [**Our work**](/work), and the [**Team**](/team). We also have a [**Substack blog**](https://digitallegislation.substack.com){:target="_blank"}.

**Latest news** - 

[**Download slides "Visualising legislative logic"**](https://osf.io/bryxa){:target="_blank"} for **LVI2025, Sydney, 13 Nov 2025** - [Law via the Internet conference](https://www.lvi2025.org/program/){:target="_blank"} (and Free Acces to Law Movement)

**Drafter-friendly logic mapping tool** - See [our slides for CALC Belfast 2025](https://osf.io/4hfbx){:target="_blank"}, this [**demonstration video**](https://youtu.be/_VZ4_FY_Nqo){:target="_blank"} and [**interactive example**](https://jl4.legalese.com/?id=8831700c-a1ee-4c21-9365-1aa410a977d0){:target="_blank"} and [**instructions**](https://osf.io/adwe6){:target="_blank"} for how a legislative drafter can put a draft provision into the **interactive, free, web-based** (no downloading needed) [**visualiser**](https://jl4.legalese.com/){:target="_blank"} that our Singapore colleagues built for us. 
- The slides and video show how a **legislative drafter can produce** an if-then version of a draft provision, which can be automatically converted into L4 to produce a flowchart-like logical map that a reader can interact with to guide them through the legislation. This limited use of L4 is a way in which legislative drafters, with no technical knowledge (just the grammar, logic and paragraphing that they use every day), can produce working code that they and their policy officers could use to check drafts. That helps drafters to picture the potential benefits of using a fuller system - elsewhere on the same site you can see examples of L4 being used more fully, including for [Jersey's Charities Law](https://github.com/smucclaw/l4-ide/blob/ian/je-charities-3/jl4/experiments/jerseyCharities2.l4){:target="_blank"}.
- For more on this see [our slides for RaC Guild Sept 2025](https://osf.io/axydq){:target="_blank"} (or [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MRs8hJY45ptGslava2WvQGvPlhp9sp59l1NbNU5ruYk/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}), & [our Substack **post**](https://substack.com/@digitallegislation/p-171875282){:target="_blank"} (& earlier [**report**](https://osf.io/x43td){:target="_blank"}). For the first half of 2025 we secured funding from the [Jersey Legal Information Board](https://www.jerseylaw.je/Pages/About.aspx){:target="_blank"} to work with the [**Centre for Digital Law**](https://cdl.smu.edu.sg/projects/research-project-computational-law-rpcl){:target="_blank"} at Singapore Management University on several ideas to see what [their **L4** DSL](https://github.com/smucclaw){:target="_blank"} (a “domain specific language” or DSL for law) can do with our project. SMU have finished their research, and L4 is now being taken forward by [Legalese](https://l4.legalese.com/){:target="_blank"}.

**Previous news** - 
- **AI** - See the [slides](https://osf.io/f3szc){:target="_blank"} from our 25 July 2025 presentation to the **Artifical Intelligence working group** of the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel in the [files in the AI section of our OSF site](https://osf.io/bkjqx/overview){:target="_blank"} (you should be able to download the slides even if OSF fails to display them).
- **Definitions pop-ups and links** - We [presented some initial results](https://youtu.be/zq6mf2zz7Eg){:target="_blank"} at the [CALC/PCC Perth 2025 conference](https://www.calc.ngo/sites/default/files/APCC-CALC%202025%20regional%20drafting%20conference%20program%20%28as%20at%2019-2-25%29_0.pdf){:target="_blank"} ([slides](https://osf.io/fqmcn){:target="_blank"} available on our OSF site).
- **Parsing** - See our [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/Gtq_lDa1qRE){:target="_blank"} of using **Excel** and Singapore's **L4** to break up the text of s1(1) **British Nationality Act** into its logical components (similar to grammatical parsing of a sentence).
