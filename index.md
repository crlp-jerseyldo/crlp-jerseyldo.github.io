# <span>Welcome to the</span> <br><em>Computer-Readable Legislation Project</em> (CRLP)

At the States of Jersey’s [Legislative Drafting Office](https://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/StatesGreffe/Pages/LegislativeDraftingOffice.aspx){:target="_blank"} (LDO) we have a 2.5-year Computer-Readable Legislation Project running to the middle of 2025 (part of the global “Rules as Code” initiative).

For more, see [**About the project**](/about), [**Our work**](/work), and the [**Team**](/team). We also have a [**Substack blog**](https://digitallegislation.substack.com){:target="_blank"}.

Our big **news** is that we have secured funding from the [Jersey Legal Information Board](https://www.jerseylaw.je/Pages/About.aspx){:target="_blank"} to work till June 2025 with the [**Centre for Computational Law**]( https://cclaw.smu.edu.sg/projects-papers/research-project-computational-law){:target="_blank"} at Singapore Management University on several ideas to see what [their **L4** DSL](https://github.com/smucclaw){:target="_blank"} (a “domain specific language” or DSL for law) can do with our project. 

For our presentation to the **Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel 2024 conference** in Jamaica, download the [**CRLP slides**](https://osf.io/erxby){:target="_blank"} from our OSF site, and the logic papers from the [**logic**](https://osf.io/qg4pb/){:target="_blank"} folder in our "parsing exercises" stream on OSF.
