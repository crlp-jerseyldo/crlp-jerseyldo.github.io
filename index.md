# <span>Welcome to the</span> <br><em>Computer-Readable Legislation Project</em> (CRLP)

At the States of Jersey’s [Legislative Drafting Office](https://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/StatesGreffe/LegislativeDraftingOffice/Pages/index.aspx){:target="_blank"} (LDO) we have a Computer-Readable Legislation Project (part of the global “Rules as Code” initiative). It was funded from 2023 to mid-2025 and is now continuing on a volunteer basis.

For more, see [**About the project**](/about), [**Our work**](/work), and the [**Team**](/team). We also have a [**Substack blog**](https://digitallegislation.substack.com){:target="_blank"}.

**Latest news** - 
**Drafter-friendly logic mapping tool** - See [**this demonstration video**](https://youtu.be/_VZ4_FY_Nqo){:target="_blank"} and [**interactive example**](https://jl4.legalese.com/?id=8831700c-a1ee-4c21-9365-1aa410a977d0){:target="_blank"} and [**instructions**](https://osf.io/adwe6){:target="_blank"} for how a legislative drafter can put a draft provision into the **interactive, free, web-based** (no downloading needed) [**visualiser**](https://jl4.legalese.com/){:target="_blank"} that our Singapore colleagues built for us. For more on this see [our slides for RaC Guild Sept 2025](https://osf.io/axydq){:target="_blank"} (or [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MRs8hJY45ptGslava2WvQGvPlhp9sp59l1NbNU5ruYk/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}), & [our Substack **post**](https://substack.com/@digitallegislation/p-171875282){:target="_blank"} (& earlier [**report**](https://osf.io/x43td){:target="_blank"}).
- For the first half of 2025 we secured funding from the [Jersey Legal Information Board](https://www.jerseylaw.je/Pages/About.aspx){:target="_blank"} to work with the [**Centre for Digital Law**](https://cdl.smu.edu.sg/projects/research-project-computational-law-rpcl){:target="_blank"} at Singapore Management University on several ideas to see what [their **L4** DSL](https://github.com/smucclaw){:target="_blank"} (a “domain specific language” or DSL for law) can do with our project. SMU have finished their research, and L4 is now being taken forward by [Legalese](https://l4.legalese.com/){:target="_blank"}.
- The video shows how a **legislative drafter can produce** an if-then version of a draft provision, which can be automatically converted into L4 to produce a flowchart-like logical map that a reader can interact with to guide them through the legislation. This limited use of L4 is a way in which legislative drafters, with no technical knowledge (just the grammar, logic and paragraphing that they use every day), can produce working code that they and their policy officers could use to check drafts. That helps drafters to picture the potential benefits of using a fuller system - elsewhere on the same site you can see examples of L4 being used more fully, including for [Jersey's Charities Law](https://github.com/smucclaw/l4-ide/blob/ian/je-charities-3/jl4/experiments/jerseyCharities2.l4){:target="_blank"}.

You can also download the [slides](https://osf.io/f3szc){:target="_blank"} from our **25 July 2025 presentation** to the **Artifical Intelligence working group** of the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel from the [files in the AI section of our OSF site](https://osf.io/bkjqx/files/osfstorage){:target="_blank"} - "CRLP - CALC AI Working Group 25-7-25.pptx" (you should be able to use the 3 dots to download even if the slides do not display).

See also our [outline plan](https://osf.io/jauqb){:target="_blank"} and our [presentation of some initial results](https://youtu.be/zq6mf2zz7Eg){:target="_blank"} at the [CALC/PCC Perth 2025 conference](https://www.calc.ngo/sites/default/files/APCC-CALC%202025%20regional%20drafting%20conference%20program%20%28as%20at%2019-2-25%29_0.pdf){:target="_blank"} on the work we have done with Word on **hyperlinking definitions**. We previously gave an interim summary our work with Singapore ([slides](https://osf.io/fqmcn){:target="_blank"} available on our OSF site), and a [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/Gtq_lDa1qRE){:target="_blank"} of using **Excel** and Singapore's **L4** on s1(1) **British Nationality Act**.
