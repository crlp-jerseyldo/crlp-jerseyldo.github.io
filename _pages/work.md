We gave a review of our workstreams at the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel 2024 conference in Jamaica - see our [**CRLP slides**](https://osf.io/erxby){:target="_blank"} (on our OSF site). We will soon post a link here to our forthcoming presentation to the [CALC-PCC 2025 regional conference in Perth](https://www.calc.ngo/sites/default/files/APCC-CALC%202025%20regional%20drafting%20conference%20program%20%28as%20at%2019-2-25%29_0.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Western Australia).

Our work is split into 4 main streams and one catch-all (click a title for more information) - 

## 1. [Artificial Intelligence and legislation](/work/artificial-intelligence-and-legislation)

Using AI (LLMs & machine learning) to help drafters identify logical structures & key elements within legislation.

## 2. [Non-technical guidance & training for drafters](/work/guidance-for-drafters)

Helping to improve the logical rigour of drafting by taking insights from modern logic and computing, but without using any tech.

## 3. [Parsing exercises & logic](/work/parsing-exercises)

Producing imaginary & real examples of provisions whose [logical](/work/logic) structures we formalise with different forms of mark-up, as well as in Mermaid, QnA & Excel, and possibly in DataLex, L4 and Blawx.

## 4. [Mock-up of a drafting tool](/work/an-ide-for-legislation)

Producing illustrative mock-ups, with a basic specification, for a potential tool to help legislative drafters create, check and mark up their logical structures, adapting the "Integratred Development Environments" that help programmers to code.

## 5. [Other - “Common Legislative Solutions”, Interpretation Law modernisation](/work/common-legislative-solutions)
* Common Legislative Solutions - parsing & digitising model provisions in a Jersey-adapted version of CLS.
* Interpretation Law for the digital age - seeing if there is scope for updating the Interpretation Law (and Interpretation Acts in other countries) to work better for humans and computers.
