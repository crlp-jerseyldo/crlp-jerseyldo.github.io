We do not see AI taking over from humans in drafting legislation. We have tried it for drafting, and it is good for suggesting provisions the drafter might not have thought of, but the drafting of the actual provisions is still nowhere near rigorous enough for workable legislation. See our experiments with drafting a Commercial Baking Act/Law with ChatGPT in 2023 and 2024 in our [AI & legislation](https://osf.io/bkjqx/){:target="_blank"} folder on OSF - 
* ChatGPT - Commercial Baking Act.pdf
* Drafting legislation with free ChatGPT as at 15 May 2024.pdf

But we do see AI helping humans.
* [Legal Drafting in the Era of Artificial Intelligence and Digitisation](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2022-06/Drafting%20legislation%20in%20the%20era%20of%20AI%20and%20digitisation%20%E2%80%93%20study.pdf){:target="_blank"} – Palmirani & others – AI could help with the **nuts and bolts** of drafting and managing draft legislation
* **LLM**-driven AI chatbots, like [Codify AI](https://codifyai.com/){:target="_blank"} for Canadian legislation, try to answer questions about legislation. But we are thinking they cannot be fully reliable (given LLM “hallucinations”), and fully explainable
* We are producing information notes to help tech firms thinking of developing a chatbot for questions about Jersey legislation

But can AI help human drafters to **parse** draft legislation (or maybe already enacted legislation) for key elements that a useful computer program would want to be able to read? We currently think a “hybrid” approach looks most likely to be useful –
* statistical/generative AI, and
* rule-based logic systems

helping each other. See Jason Morris [“GPT4 & Rules as Code”](https://gauntlet173.github.io/post/2023_04_12_llm_and_rac/){:target="_blank"}

We are working with [Digital Jersey](https://www.digital.je){:target="_blank"}, Go Reply & Google on a test of how **[Google Cloud’s AIs](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/?hl=en){:target="_blank"}** (beyond LLMs) can learn to identify standard/logical elements in drafts. That would help drafters make their drafts computer-readable.
* **Definitions** – scope, defined term, definition
* **Offences** – offence creation, penalty
* **Vires** to make subsidiary legislation - person given power, type of instrument
* **If-then** and-or-not structures (next) – conditions, effects, scope of and/or/not

In the longer run we imagine LLMs being useful as the interface with the user, guiding the user to a useful item of legislation for a logic-based reasoner to ask questions and give fully sourced answers, but perhaps with the LLM then giving a summary and suggesting further questions. We think of that as an AI and reasoner sandwich - see our [AI sandwhich](https://osf.io/8v5bd){:target="_blank"} slides
