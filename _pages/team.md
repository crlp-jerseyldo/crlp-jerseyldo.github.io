Hello! I’m really excited to share a glimpse into my academic and professional journey that led me here at the CRLP. During my LL.B. at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Scott Wortley for my dissertation, I delved into the complexities of law in our digital era. This experience was a turning point for me, as it illuminated the potential of technology to revolutionise traditional legal practices. I found a particular passion in exploring how legislation can be crafted and improved through technological tools, making the process more efficient and accessible.

It was around this time that I met Matthew, whose insights and enthusiasm deeply resonated with me. We have shared interests in the innovative area of Rule as Code – the concept of transforming legal rules into computer code to make laws more understandable and executable by machines. This approach has the potential to bridge the gap between legal experts and the wider community, ensuring laws are interpreted consistently and applied more effectively.

Joining the CRLP felt like a natural step in my quest to contribute to this evolving field. I’m keen on pushing the boundaries of how we think about and interact with legislation in the digital age, exploring ways technology can aid in drafting laws that are clear, precise, and adaptable to rapid societal changes.

Dr Laurence Diver has worked at the intersection of Rules as Code, web technologies and legal theory for a number of years. Most recently he was senior researcher in the 5-year project [COHUBICOL](https://cohubicol.com){:target="_blank"} (Counting as a Human Being in the Era of Computational Law), where he also co-founded the [*Journal of Cross-disciplinary Research in Computational Law*](https://journalcrcl.org){:target="_blank"} with Prof. Mireille Hildebrandt. 

He holds PhD, LLM, and LLB degrees from the University of Edinburgh, as well as diplomas in legal practice and software development. Before his PhD he was a full stack web developer, a research assistant at the Universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde, and a legal assistant at the Scottish Law Commission.

His work at the crossover of design, democracy and the Rule of Law is reflected in a range of [publications](https://laurencediver.net/publications-and-presentations/){:target="_blank"} and open-access book, [*Digisprudence: Code as Law Rebooted*](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-digisprudence-code-as-law-rebooted.html){:target="_blank"} (Edinburgh University Press 2022).
