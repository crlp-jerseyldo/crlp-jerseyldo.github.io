Hello -- I am a legislative drafter working half time on the Computer-Readable Legislation Project. I attended the European University Institute’s summer school on law and logic in 2018, because for a long time I had had a nagging feeling that legislative drafters and logicians have more in common than we realise. After that I took an interest in the “Rules as Code” movement which was just starting in New Zealand and then spread to Australia and worldwide. My main concern is to bring the perspective of legislative drafters  to computational law and Rules as Code (particularly the legislative drafters in Commonwealth countries, where we now share a rigorous approach to drafting). I aim to ensure that legislative drafters (and the people who make law and are subject to it) can benefit from the opportunities that technology is offering, as well as the insights that logic and computing can offer into how we can sharpen the discipline of our drafting. I have spoken at events for the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel and elsewhere, and written for CALC’s journal “The Loophole” and other publications. I have also been teaching part time at Jersey’s Institute of Law, particularly on how to read legislation, as well as in modules on public law and jurisprudence. Previously I was deputy head of Jersey’s Legislative Drafting Office, and I worked as a legislative drafter in the UK’s Overseas Territory in Cyprus from 2004 (which means I have drafted for both entry to and exit from the EU). Before that I worked in England at the Law Commission, a university, community law centres and a private practice legal aid firm, after qualifying as a solicitor in 1990 (now non-practising).

Hello! I’m really excited to share a glimpse into my academic and professional journey that led me here at the CRLP. During my LL.B. at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Scott Wortley for my dissertation, I delved into the complexities of law in our digital era. This experience was a turning point for me, as it illuminated the potential of technology to revolutionise traditional legal practices. I found a particular passion in exploring how legislation can be crafted and improved through technological tools, making the process more efficient and accessible.

It was around this time that I met Matthew, whose insights and enthusiasm deeply resonated with me. We have shared interests in the innovative area of Rule as Code – the concept of transforming legal rules into computer code to make laws more understandable and executable by machines. This approach has the potential to bridge the gap between legal experts and the wider community, ensuring laws are interpreted consistently and applied more effectively.

Joining the CRLP felt like a natural step in my quest to contribute to this evolving field. I’m keen on pushing the boundaries of how we think about and interact with legislation in the digital age, exploring ways technology can aid in drafting laws that are clear, precise, and adaptable to rapid societal changes.

I have worked at the intersection of technology, design and legal & regulation theory for close to a decade now, with my focus shifting towards Rules as Code since 2020. Most recently I was senior researcher in the 5-year project [COHUBICOL](https://cohubicol.com){:target="_blank"} (Counting as a Human Being in the Era of Computational Law), where I co-founded the [*Journal of Cross-disciplinary Research in Computational Law*](https://journalcrcl.org){:target="_blank"} with Prof. Mireille Hildebrandt. 

I hold PhD, LLM, and LLB degrees from the University of Edinburgh, as well as diplomas in legal practice and software development. Before embarking on a PhD I was a full stack web developer, a research assistant at the Universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde, and a legal assistant at the Scottish Law Commission.

My work at the crossover of design, democracy and the Rule of Law is reflected in a range of [publications](https://laurencediver.net/publications-and-presentations/){:target="_blank"} and open-access book [*Digisprudence: Code as Law Rebooted*](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-digisprudence-code-as-law-rebooted.html){:target="_blank"} (Edinburgh University Press 2022).

Margaux McQuilton worked for the project as an intern at various times from June 2023 to March 2024, while studying a double degree in English and French law at Jersey's Institute of Law and Toulouse University. Her main work was on parsing imaginary and real legislative provisions for if-then, and feeding that into Mermaid, QnA, Excel & DataLex. In December 2023 she ran an event "The future of AI & Law", bringing together computing students & law students to work on ways to digitise examples of legislation. In early 2024 she organised an ELSA essay competition on AI and law, and she has made the [shortlist for the Jersey TechAwards](https://twitter.com/InstofLawJersey/status/1757399603832406368 "https://twitter.com/instoflawjersey/status/1757399603832406368"){:target="_blank"} in April 2024.
